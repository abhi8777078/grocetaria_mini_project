                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>To provide customers a platform from where they can buy products from their homes at competitive
                        prices as compared to online platforms</p>
                    <p>To design a simple and convenient platform that can integrate the distributed and unorganized
                        sector of street vendors.</p>

                <div class="m112">
                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p>Home delivery is a service and what service can you think of that doesnâ€™t come without a fee? Not
                        many. Businesses have to pay for the gas and the personnel to drive orders from a store or
                        fulfillment center to residences or businesses and in many cases that cost is passed on to
                        consumers.</p>
                    <p>When fruit or vegetable is ordered via an app or online then someone who is not going to eat or
                        use it, is picking out them then it can be hard to always pick the fresh and undamaged
                        vegetables and fruits, like someone who is only shopping once a week would do.

                    <h3>Future scope
                    </h3>
                    <p>This model will help all the
                        vendors to make them organized
                        and customers will get fresh fruits
                        and vegetables</p>
                    <p>In further developments we will use machine learning algorithms to predict daily buys of
                        customers from previous records.</p>
